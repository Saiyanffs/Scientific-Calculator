# Scientific-Calculator

Mini project that I've been working on.<br>
This project is hosted <a href="https://scientific-calculator-318d8.web.app/">here</a>.

Even thou this is a simple project I tried to respect all proper ways and rules of writing clean code,<br>
So files are already very performance friendly and it is responsive.

In further versions of this project I plan to add more functions,<br>
As well as options to save some calculated numbers to be used again.

Style.css = "autoprefixer", "css-nano"<br>
Script.js = "concat", "babel", "terser"
